I had no trouble building and installing cyusbserial and with a little pain got SWIG all set up, but not only does my Python/C++ system not work, the cyusbserialtest provided with cyusbserial is also failing to communicate with the device. It detects the USB device and recognizes it as a CyUSBSerial device, and the vendor/pid match the sample code from General Vision (I'm not sure if this is a Cypress vendor/pid or a General Vision vendor/pid). Everything seems good to go, but when I select the device in cyusbserialtest, then select the SPI interface (which is my preference and is how the Windows code works, not I2C), and then select a page address and length (just random since I don't know what these mean) in cyusbserialtest, it times out inside spiWaitForIdle() (line 312 of cyusbserialtest.c in my version of the code) at the call to CySpiReadWrite(). That call just keeps returning (immediately) and the timeout counter in spiWaitForIdle() eventually counts down to 0 and bails.Likewise, meaningful SPI commands relevant to the surrounding board (the NeuroShield), which I know the board responds to via other SPI interfaces, do not respond when those same SPI messages are issued through CyUSBSerial.Since this is not my own code, just CyUSBSerial's own sample code (cyusbserialtest), I am at a loss as to what I could possibly be doing wrong. Shouldn't this code essentially work out of the box? I'm not sure how to proceed.What is the meaning of the page address and length in the sample? Should it work with literally any page address and length within the prescribed ranges?Thank you.","Show Less","kwiley","https://community.infineon.com/html/@9FEDFFCBA9FB60B2EB3889D72F5D4A95/badge_icons/Give%20accepted%20solutions_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@4845BE2359674DBCE16B5A976BD412C8/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_5.svg","2023/4/23","805","0","10","","","","","","","","","","","https://community.infineon.com/html/@5314BCBE1A8075802F557371685FC5CB/badge_icons/Login_5.svg"

使用的芯片CYUSB3014-BZXI,  ，fpga+3014的板子，然后通过USB线连到PC机，用的linux系统 , PC机reboot系统软重启后，PC电脑端无法识别到CYUSB3014，需要重新拔插一下usb线才能在电脑端识别到芯片。

测试不给3014烧任何固件，关机启动是可以lsusb到3014的，但是一软重启，用lsusb就找不到3014了，请问有什么办法解决这个问题，谢谢。

When I connect the ESP32 I can receive serial transmission in the CoolTerm serial monitor. I can place the ESP32 in download mode and I get the appropriate message; ""waiting for download"". - just as a check of course.  CoolTerm is not connected when I am attempting to communicate with the CY7C. However the download does not initiate. It has happened maybe three times out of 100 attempts. My signals look good on both lines when scoped. There is activity on the Rx_LED and Tx_LED, but no connection to the ESP32. I can use the Microchip MCP2221A and there is never an issue. It connects every time. I want to make use of the RTS signal for a separate piece of logic which is why I'm experimenting with this chip. If I can't figure it out I'll have to go back to the MCP2221A and just use timings instead. To sum up: connections are good, signals are good, I can transmit from the ESP32, but not receive it appears.","Show Less","DanielLongo","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BB7CBF68EA79EE2CE80785E7E8F100B7/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@4F31C10E63A8DEAD5447F4ACE23F9B35/badge_icons/Login_1.svg","2023/1/27","199","0","1","Thanks","","","","","","","","","",""

For which I decided to use FX2LP. I am using FX2_to_extsyncFIFO example, which is configured for bulk transfer. The issue I am facing is that when I connect the sine signal, generated from signal generator, to GPIF of FX2LP. I am using Tiva c launchpad to convert analog signal to digital signal. The tiva c has 12 bit ADC which I configured for timer triggered. In TD_Poll function, I am reading data from GPIF in for loop. If you see the example which is metioned, you get an idea how I am reading the data from GPIF. As you can see the given figures, I got one or two cycle of signal but after that the data lost and it started from middle of some cycle. I tested the program, with 50Hz, 200Hz and 500Hz frequencies. You can see the figures of these frequencies below.","Show Less","yazan_ee","https://community.infineon.com/html/@DB310C00FCF7164DF57F5E9E38A34695/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@9FC46A0208CA612D6CB0C9007C71D09A/badge_icons/Login_10.svg","2022/12/4","462","0","5","50Hz","Thanks","200Hz","And only it is important that how we send request from the host (PC) to get data. I add some functions to the code of control center of FX2LP. I added two timers to the code. One timer is to send request to get data from FX2LP after every 2ms, and second timer is used to plot the data on chart. The timer which is responsible for plotting is the microtimer, which runs very fast. And I don't think this is creating any issue. I am not sure about the First timer, that send request for the data, if it is creating that issue or not. I think this can be the synchronization issue. I have attached both codes, The code that I run on FX2LP and the code which I run on PC and also the code which is burned into the Tiva C microcontroller. Kindly help me out with this issue. If you need anything else kindly tell me.","Regards Yazan","","","","","","https://community.infineon.com/html/@5314BCBE1A8075802F557371685FC5CB/badge_icons/Login_5.svg"

In our Windows driver when I attempted to send a URB that packages that vendor request, USBD seems to block indefinitely. After seeing that, I put in logic to cancel the IRP after a timeout elapsed. However, when I went to continue through our usual process of downloading firmware, it seems to malfunction, as if it consumed part of my invalid vendor request and cached it before processing the subsequent 0xa0 vendor request.","","~Thanks","","","","","","","Is this just something I should completely avoid doing [sending unrecognized vendor request codes to it]? I managed to move on to a different technique but my motivation was to try to discern between our device having renumerated with firmware and a fresh firmware-less enumeration state.

Even when the transfers are done separately from each other in time the problem still happens.","","","","","The USB host controller is an Intel EHCI device built into the chip-set.  The software mostly polls the EHCI, and the only interrupt is the Interrupt On Completion of transfer descriptors.  The interrupt service routine examines the descriptors to see which ones have completed, and sets operating system even flags associated with the completed transfers.

Right now we are working on programming them with the ISSP protocol, going off information found in AN44168 2. Is there a version of the ISSP source code that explicitly supports CY7C64315? 3. If not, what are the parameters/vectors needed by CY7C64315 that needs to be set in the HSSP_CY8Cxxxx source code?

On which your usb controller cy7c67300 ez-host is present. I found drivers, as well as some of your programs, for testing usb controllers. Such as control center, cyconsole, etc. Using cyconsole, I ran into a problem when transmitting and receiving data, because I do not have data about the ""Request Code"", ""wValue"" and ""wIndex"", in the cyconsole user guide, it is written that these data can be obtained from the vendor. I will attach a screenshot of the main data page and the controller. I also wanted to inquire about registers. I have written a program in vhdl for reading status, reading registers and writing data. But I ran into the problem of reading after writing to the user space registers, and in internal memory and external memory. Reading is in progress, but the data does not match the written one. As if the registers are reserved. When writing data to the mailbox, and then reading it, the port displays ""DEAD"", which does not allow you to check the correctness of the program. I tested the program in standalone mode. I would be very happy if you could tell me which registers can be used for writing and reading, without reserved bits.

This routine would be called 4 times to load the entire 4K bytes of data.  I've enabled a GPIF Crtl output line that I can monitor on the scope to see when its loading the FIFO and then have Port A1 pin toggling while in this routine to help me debug what is going on.","Show Less","RoWa_685396","","","2019/12/3","856","0","3","","}","{","IOA ^= 0x02;          //toggle pin to see whats going on","SYNCDELAY;","GPIFTRIG = GPIFTRIGRD | GPIF_EP2; // R/W=1, EP[1:0]=FIFO_EpNum for EPx read(s)","green boxes","red boxes","BYTE Send_EP2_wordsBurst (WORD NumOfWords  )","The issue is that I'm missing data that is coming from the FPGA. The FPGA is producing data at a relatively slow 1MHz rate. I've got the GPIF configured to read data in when the DataValid signal is high. From the attached scope pic this works most of the time (the ). The issue is that it seems like the GPIF transfer process will hang randomly for 125us and then resume. From a code standpoint, since the PA1 pin is still toggling at the same rate the CPU is still in the routine below waiting for the FIFO to fill, however during this 125us period (the  in the pic) its missing data.

Is that the newest driver for the CY7C68013? Or should  I use the CyUSB3 driver ()  although the CY7C68013 is a USB 2.0 device? Whats the difference between CyUSB3 - API  and CyUSB - API. Are they compatible or do I have to adapt the existing Code? Moreover the naming of the  CyUSB3 driver is quite confusing - The driver is named cyusb3.sys, (new Driver?) the library CyAPI.lib (Old Library?).","Show Less","yvjec_3905651","","","2018/12/10","3077","0","5","","","","","","","","","","Under https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-12366 I found CY7C68013 listed that it is compatible with the CyUSB3 however under http://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/ez-usb-fx3-software-development-kit (for the lib) I could found it.",""

I'm working on a project that is continuously filling the endpoint FIFO through an externally clocked GPIF interfaced data source. It's fairly high bandwidth (~10MBytes/sec) so I'm using 1024 byte quad-buffering and isochronous trnasfers (1-2 packets/uframe).  Periodically the host will not be able to keep up with the data rate and will fail to issue transfer requests for every frame. This is something I expect and do not consider it ""the problem"" because I am trying to make this device work on the slowest single-board computers I can manage.  Also, for the nature of the data I am streaming, it does not matter very much at all if I drop packets. What is 100% critical is that I maintain data alignment.  For example, if I consider the original data stream from the external device, I need to ensure that the first byte I read from it ends up in the first byte of the transfer. I need to ensure that the 1024th byte from the device ends up in the 1024th byte of the stream ... the 2048th byte ends up in the 2048th byte of the output stream, etc, etc. If I happen to drop a packet somewhere then I simply need to know that I failed to transfer 1024 bytes and insert 1024 bytes of zeros (or noise) in their place.","Show Less","Anonymous","","","2016/7/30","329","0","1","The issue that I'm having is, using AUTOIN, when the host gets behind and I commit the 4th output packet, the FIFO buffer goes full and the GPIF device stops writing to it. When the host finally gets around to clearing the buffer and the GPIF can once again begin writing to the FIFO buffer, the data stream is no longer aligned. The FULL flag certainly won't be cleared 1024, 2048, etc. bytes later to stay aligned.  What I would like is the following behavior: When the 4th packet is committed to the USB domain, the 1st packet awaiting transmission is discarded to make room for another packet. It needs to behave such that not even a single byte from the GPIF device is discarded on a full buffer. I would be even fine if the entire USB buffer was cleared when full (discarding 4 packets) as long as the very next byte from the GPIF device can make it into a FIFO.  Anyone have an idea on how to produce or closely approximate this behavior?  Thanks for reading and for any help.","","","","","","","","","",""

I read a few documents from Cypress and have the impression that here I could find someone who certainly has experienced this and might help me! I'm hoping for the best.","My implementation of UVC on a Cortex M-7 works so far that I am able to connect a camera via USB and stream its video data onto my RAM, and send it out via UDP for debugging on my computer.","The issue I'm talking about is this: My camera supports several formats and frames. I am interested in uncompressed (YUV). There I can choose between 5 different resolutions, ranging from 160x120 to 1280x1024. During UVC negotiation after I probe with the request, e.g. Frame 02, Format 03, I get always(!) the reply (GET) that the device indeed will send me the desired frame and format (e.g. 02/03). This works the way it should.","Now when stream starts and keep on polling, I'm checking for the FID bit, since the end of frame bit is not reliable on my camera. By checking the Frame start bit I receive CONSTANT frame sizes of 342160 bytes representing 171080 Pixels.","","","","Furthermore I notice that, when drawing the RGB converted bytes/image, that in fact I can see TWO images stacked vertically. So first image is 182x470 and the second image is 181x470. Unusual resolutions. Also the images are distorted and stretched vertically!","Therefore I visualise the images (after reception) like this:","I either only consider every 8th row (dropping the 7 sequential rows) resulting in an 182x118 image which shows both images squeezed.",""

Then the PC stops sending any more requests to the chip over the wire. We observed it with a USB protocol analyzer. When the cypress firmware enters this state it does not recover till we unplug it and plug it back in. Then communication resumes. We are completely lost on what would cause this. EP2 is OUT, EP4 is IN, EP6 is OUT, EP8 is IN. Its a self powered device but in firmware its configured as a bus powered device. I don't know what the impact of this is. Also, I had to disable the system going into ""Sleep"" mode to see if it worked.

The driver communication is done via IOCTL functions. Sometimes we have to deal with noisy environment where EMI-sources might have a significant impact to the USB signal quality.","On the low-level site, every transfer is normally stuffed by a couple of different status informations like Framing-Errors/CRC-Error/Ack-Errors,...a.s.o. (like the USBD-status as denoted in the USB2.0 specification). Additionally there are also error counter available which are incremented after a transfer fails. These informations will be highly interesting if you have to evaluate EMI and cable quality issues.","Now the question: Are there any possibilities to readout this (low-level) informations from the driver or are there other possible sources (API-functions to access the USB-host driver status,...) which will provide the low level transfer status?","p.s.: The USBD status which is part of the ""Single_Transfer"" structure in the CyUSB driver shows always zero .I think this is normal since an overlapped transfer call return always immediately with IO_PENDING and there is no other possibility to get dedicated informations about the usbdstatus/ntstatus while using the DeviceIOControl-function.","","","","","","",""

I am not an Engineer and I simply used the reference schematic using the TP378833 voltage regulator. I am “hoping” that I can simply add a RC circuit to the device to provide a brief (~3 second) guard against this. I was hoping someone could tell me first if this is feasible and second, do I put it before the regulator or after and will it effect power consumption?

The .NET Programmers Reference states that you can create a list of USB devices on the hub and can access them individually. However reading the driver documentation, it talks about the Product ID and the Vendor ID as a way to locate a particular device. If I am mass manufacturing PSoC based devices, I would've assumed that all my products would have the same Product and Vendor IDs based on what is required in the .inf file. Is this the case? This makes it sound like the library is geared towards ONE Cypress PSoC device and all the others attached to the hub as something else.","If I'm manufacturing PSoC based devices, does each individual device have to have it's own unique Product ID?

However tech support at Cypress has been a bit lacking - seeming to think that this is going to be very difficult to do. I'm pressing on anyway.","","","","I believe I have all the registers defined in what they need to be but am a bit confused by a few points. First register TX_IRQ_Status bit 1 [TXC IRQ] and 0 [TXE IRQ]. The wording is, well shall we say it leaves a bit of uncertainty. One would think that you could read this and if, when read, TXC were set then TXE would be valid - since indeed the transaction is done! However there is something about if it reads TXC=1 TXE=0 that you then have to read it again! I'm not exactly sure why. I believe it's saying that one can get a completed transaction and have an error in the transmission but not have the TXE set! If so then what use is it??","","","Essentially all I am trying to do is to use it in transaction mode (by the way nowhere in the manual does it say specifically HOW to get it INTO transaction mode except a veiled statement for bit 7 of XACT_Cfg), load the tx buffer, send 3 bytes, receive an ACK (which is automatic in transaction mode) and just confirm that I have received an ACK - then repeat 100mS later.

However, above code takes 35mSec to transfer like next.  START 1st Frame has one Setup transaction.(8byte) 2nd Frame has only one  DATA1 transaction.(8byte)   // =  buf[0] 3rd Frame has only one  DATA0 transaction.(8byte)   //  = buf[1] 4th Frame has only one  DATA1 transaction.(8byte)   //  = buf[2] ...  It looks like CYUSB.SYS reuqest only one transaction per Frame.(So data rate is 8KB/Sec) And I test with other USB driver(not free), I can take about 56KB/Sec(90% bandwidth) with same device and firmware. So, it is not a USB specific impact. Can I send multiple transactions to EP0 per one Frame(1mSec) with CYUSB.SYS?","","","","","","","","","",""

I have constructed an interface using an FPGA to drive the EP2FIFO. I am using the EP2FIFO FF as FLAGB, and the FPGA uses the flag to tell it when to stop sending data. Data is requested using EP8, and that part is working fine. However, EP2FIFO FF is going high after 64 bytes, which made me think the EP was working in low speed mode. However, I can see, using UCView, that the max packet size for the EP2 is 512 bytes, and the connection is high speed. I have to believe I m making an obvious mistake, but I do not see it.

In this configuration what does the OTGID pin have to be tied to +3.3V or GND or left floating as I intend to use that port as a peripheral. Also is this configuration valid to use meaning port 1A as peripheral and 2A and 2B as hosts.  2. I came across some other application note from Cypress about HPI port and I am confused by one statement I found in it. It stated that BIOS will not configure port 1A or 2AS in co-processor mode. What does this imply? How else would I configure port 1A as peripheral and port 2A as host?  Thanks.","Show Less","Anonymous","","","2013/6/3","250","0","1","","","","","","","","","","",""

A few years ago, we contracted a local firm to design an electronics board for specialist fast timing. It uses the CY7C68013A microcontroller for management purposes and for communication with a PC over USB. It turned out that our sub-contractor did not write a device driver, but merely supplied the Cypress CyUSB.sys driver and a simple user mode wrapper around the required parts of the CyUSB.lib library. Indeed it turns out that the sub-contractor does not have the skills to write a driver, their speciality is electronics.   All the other higher level driver software has been written in-house, is user-mode and 32bit. We have not bothered to sign any of the code, as in our world it simply doesn't add any value. We sell only 5-10 units a year, mostly as part of instrument sales and mostly with a PC supplied by us. We have a personal relationship with our small number of clients and they have to trust us on a range of issues; possible errors with the drivers is the least of their worries. In any case, we haven't actually touched the driver code as such, CyUSB.sys, we have merely changed the .inf file to match the vendor and product IDs in the code that runs the board. We do have our own official USB vendor code, purchased a long time ago.   All this has been working absolutely fine with Windows XP based PCs; the message warning about the unsigned driver is usally only seen by us and one can elect to ignore it. Anyway, I am not embarrassed for the client to see such a warning message; they understand the specialist nature of what we do. Now, however, we are being forced towards Windows 7. We have run the hardware with Windows 7 32 bit, where one can still override the complaint about the lack of driver signing. We have also managed to make it run under Windows 7 64bit, having followed the procedure for disabling driver signing. I will be forced to use Windows 7 64bit in future; it now seems to be the default on all new PCs. I have not yet found a method for running our hardware that does not involve disabling all signing protection and requiring our users to run permanently in a test mode.   So, ideally there would be a way to make a given Windows 7 64bit installation run our hardware without disabling all protections. If anyone knows how to do this they would make me very happy by telling me, but I am coming to the conclusion that Microsoft have succeeded in making this impossible.  Otherwise we have to get the driver signed. But there is a great deal of confusing information on this topic. I really need a walkthrough that is completly specific to Windows 7 64bit. I think I might have discovered that the driver has to go through the WHQL process, requiring a client server setup and test results submitted to Microsoft. Is this necessary even though the CyUSB comes from Cypress? I think that not all signing certificates will be suitable. I only need to do this once. There is not going to be any upgrades to this part of the software. It should last us until we have to design a completely new board - some more years - our world does not move at the pace of consumer electronics.   I would be very happy to use a sub-contractor, if I could find somone suitable at a sensible cost (bearing in mind the very small numbers). I am not sure whether the signing process requires one of our actual boards, as well as the driver; we only have a few available at a time. The hardware does not fall into any standard class, so there is very little that general testing software could do with it.   The whole thing is very frustrating, especially since we haven't actually touched any driver code. I would be very grateful for advice from someone who has been through this process. Sorry there is so much detail, but I wanted the context to be clear so the suggestions are appropriate.

Anything below 1024 byes loaded works, while anything above 1024 bytes does not… in our own software, the CyConsole software, or CyControl software. They all behave identically regarding this. But we have no idea why this would be the case, since even on the older FX chip the code size limit is 6976 (0x1B40) bytes which is still much greater than 1024 (0x400) bytes. So there should not even be a problem like this.","","",""

The problem is that I want to use the clock of camera which is running at 5 MHZ so that i can synchronize my LSYNC(HSYNC) AND FSYNC(VSYNC) and grab a frame out of the camera. I implemented GPIF single read just to make sure that i able to receive any data from the camera. I used the GPIF example to data from the camera.

Part of the data flow requires access to the Slave FIFO from both external logic and the firmware. Using the EZ-USB TRM Revision D reference and following Section 9.3.8 I've been able to edit the data in the FIFO that was written initially by external logic (our FPGA). However, in assembling the IN packet to the host in the FIFO, we'd like to write header data to the FIFO *before* the external logic writes (and hopefully appends) the FPGA data. Currently, I find that the external logic/FPGA always overwrites the header data written to the FIFO by the firmware. Is there a way to control the FX2 FIFO pointer that tracks the writing of FIFO data by external logic, such that I could advance it the header length through firmware before the FPGA-based  Slave FIFO write?","","","","","",""

I followed the following steps and could use the LabVIEW standard examples like USB RAW-Bulk and USB RAW-Control to communicate with the device. I used the example projec Bulkloop which could be found among the firmware examples for FX2LP with the DVK contents. Bulkloop is simply taking OUT data from the out endpoint and looping it back to the IN endpoint, so host receives the same data as it sends.  I used a random PID_VID of 0555_0666 just for trying it on my PC.","Show Less","Anonymous","","","2012/12/14","768","0","0","Here are the steps that I followed: 1. Most important of all, installed the latest version of LabVIEW and NI-VISA package. 2. Because FX2LP is a USB RAW class device, we need to configure the NI-VISA to use that driver. Basically using the NI-VISA driver wizard we can build an inf file for that PID_VID which will bind the device to the NI-VISA drivers. Complete Steps to follow are given at the link:  3. I checked my device using the VISA Interactive Control and I could see the communication as expected. 4. I opened the LabVIEW project USB RAW-Bulk from the examples in LabVIEW. You will get this example only after you have installed the NI-VISA drivers appropriately.  Help->Find Examples->(Search for) USB RAW bulk and you will find this example. 5. Attach your device, (it should be attached I suppose) check device manager if it shows the device as NI-VISA device. Run the LabVIEW project, you should see the device now in the VISA Resource Name drop down menu. Click Open Session to open communication session with the device. 6. Type some data in the Bulk Out window, click Bulk Out. Data would be sent across (you will see no error in the error window). Now click on Bulk In (you can leave the data field size to be 512 bytes), you would see the same data being received from the device.  I attached some snapshots for reference.  I hope this is useful for some LabVIEW beginners like me.","Enjoy..!!!","http://www.ni.com/white-paper/4478/en#toc2","","fx2lp","","","","","",""

I compared time stamps and it was the same as coming from CY4640 over on my Windows 7 machine. Nevertheless, I copied the driver from my laptop to my Windows 7 machine. No, still didn't work. So it seems NEITHER the CY3663 install NOR the cyusbgen.sys driver work on Windows 7. If forced to do so, I can work on my old laptop for part of this work. If you have a solution to this problem, please let me know.","-----------------------------------------------------",""

In this code, it never makes it through more than one successful iteration of XferData. XferData either:  1. Just times out on the first iteration. 2. Completes a couple ""Zero-length"" transfers and then times out. 3. Pulls in a first chunk of data, and then on the next iteration times out.

So on USB Control Centre I flashed the 4k page file.iic file using the ProgramFX2>64kb eeprom menu  , (as I had a 4k NAND chip installed in U4 and U8 on the NX2LP board as it came shipped with these).  The operation completed sucessfully, but now my device does not appear in the device manager at all, even with view hidden devices setting on.  I am worried that I may have made the EEPROM inaccesiblle.","","","","Can you please help me to get the kit back to factory settings and help me get started to mount the device as a drive (which your kit promises comes out the box!)?","Your help is much appreciated.","",""

I downloaded my FPGA configration, and any transfere i try always endups in timeout.","","","","I tryed the bulkloop example provided by cypress and it works fine. My application also worked fine before i reinstalled my system. I have installed the drivers i used in previous times, but nothing works.

It works fine but I cannot correctly detect the EEPROM size using the 0xA5 vendor request. I stop the CPU by writing 0x01 to 0xE600 via the 0xA0 request. After this I download the complete vend_ax in one block to the ram starting at 0x0000. After sending 0x00 to the 0xE600 the vend_ax is running and responding on the vendor requests. I can program and read the connected EEPROM. But the I2C Type request 0xA5 always reflect the EEPROM state at power-up. For firmware Update, we disable the 24C64 EEPROM by pulling down the A0 line to ground. Even if I remove the jumper before or after downloading and starting the vend_ax firmware, the A5 request always gives me 0x00. If the jumper is removed at power-up, the A5 gives me the correct 0x01. If I remove the EEPROM detection all works great, buts we want to go the safe way... What are we doing wrong? I used the FXEeprom and fxload-libusb code together with the vend_ax application note for understanding the 2nd stage bootloader function. I use the vend_ax.hex from the fxload-libusb project. With the extracted vend_ax.hex from the source of FXEeprom Example the behavior is the same (but the programming itself is much slower...).","","","","","","","","","",""

The data is transferred from FPGA through the slave FIFO interface in AUTOIN mode (auto-commit with size of 1024-byte) to PC.   Endpoint 2 is used, the fifo uses double buffering with packet size of 1024 bytes. The external interface is set to 16 bits wide. The interface clock IFCLK is driven by the FPGA, and is inverted internally in the FX2 (through IFCONFIG setting). Clock frequency is 48 MHz. Initialization of the endpoint buffer is performed as directed by the example provided in the EZ-USB technical reference manual.   The observed behavior is that, PC is waitting for data of usb ,when a 2048-byte packet is pushed to the slave fifo interface, it is tansferred to the USB domain and read by the PC. After two packets is read, the FX2 reports that the FIFO is not empty.At that point reading EP2FIFOBCH:L reports that the FIFO contains 62 bytes of data, which was never explicitly pushed to the slave fifo by the FPGA.   Has anyone encountered problems like this before, and has he been able to solve them?   I would appreciate any help.","Show Less","Anonymous","","","2010/5/20","2147","0","25","","","","","","","","","","",""

PSoC Creator has an user module called USBFS which, as far as I understand it, helps you implementing USB endpoints. In the datasheet of this module there is an example for emulating a 3-buttom-USB-mouse on a PSoC. I tryied this an it works perfectly.  However I would now like to implement an USB-audio-device with at least one channel for the input and one for the output of audio data. It seems that the USBFS-module supports audio deviced, like it supports HIDs. But I found no examples, ANs or tutorials how to implement USB-audio. There are a lot of different options and parameters and I was not able to figure out, what most of them are for.  Does anyone have experience with this, know any examples or ANs? I would appreciate every help you can offer to point me in the right direction. Right now I have no real clue how to start, at least no other than randomly change the parameters and see what happens.

If so, it checks to see if there is at least one packet in the peripheral domain for EP2. Since EP2 is placed into auto mode, the firmware does not need to check if the host sent a USB packet. The USB packets are automatically committed to be used by the GPIF engine. Therefore, the firmware’s job is to check if at least one packet has been committed to the peripheral domain. Then, if the external FIFO is not full, the TC value is set up for word-wide operation. The TC value is a 32-bit register field, but for this application only the lower 16-bit fields are necessary. Since each GPIF FIFO Write transaction sends 512 bytes to the external FIFO over a 16-bit interface, the number of transactions is always half the number of bytes actually contained within the endpoint buffer. The appropriate TC value is set up for either high-speed (256) or full-speed (32) operation. The appropriate flow state registers are then set up for the FIFO Write transaction, and a write to the GPIFTRIG register with the appropriate bits triggers the transaction from EP2OUT. The code then waits for the transaction to complete before exiting out of the “if” nest.","The USB packets are automatically committed to be used by the GPIF engine. Therefore, the firmware’s job is to check if at least one packet has been committed to the peripheral domain.""","I don't  understand these sentens:""","What will happen if I send 10 words(not equal to 512 Bytes) to the EP2.","I found if I send 10 words to EP2,I cannot send my vendor requet to ez-usb,why??","","","",""

And this is my try at using an FX2. I've been working on trying to get the EZ-USB FX2 to transfer data from an ADC (Analog devices 9251) but just can't get it to work. I've tried just about everything at this point so now I'm going to the developer community for help.","Show Less","Anonymous","","","2010/6/12","298","0","1","Our board has 3 main components at this point: a Microchip PIC32 micro-controller, the AD9251 ADC and the FX2. The PIC32 is something that I'm very familiar with and that part of the project is working well [now], The PIC32 controls the ADC and all communication with the host is done with the FX2. The idea is that you send a [vendor] command to the FX2 which uses GPIO pins to signal the PIC32 to start the ADC so that data (which is connected to the FX2 via the FD0:15 bus) will flow to the FX2 (which is configured in salve FIFO mode) and to the host.","So that's how it's supposed to work. I know that the PIC32 is doing what it is supposed to do as is the ADC. Unfortunately, no data from the ADC ever gets into the EP6 FIFO of the FX2. I've read through the TRM many times, looked at what few examples there are and added a lot of debugging vendor commands so that I can see what's in the EP6 FIFO and the various registers. Everything looks like it should be working but I get no data from the ADC into the EP6 FIFO.","I've attached my periph.c file (I didn't rename it yet) to show what I have done. If anyone can take a quick look at it and see if I am doing anything wrong, it would be greatly appreciated. I had originally set AUTOIN to on for EP6 (that didn't seem to work) but then tried setting when I actually get the [vendor] start command so that it did a 0->1 transition. Again, that did nothing.","I'm really at a loss here. The FX2 is supposed to be a very simple chip to use. Using slave FIFO mode is ""just supposed to work"". Of course, like most other things that's not the case. So if anyone can point me in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated.","","","","","","",""

Instead, it comes up as ""uknown device"" with VID=0x0000, PID=0x0000.  I have also tried an even simpler test of not changing the default values for device descriptor that the BIOS starts up with, and it still doesn't work. I know for sure that SUSB1_DEV_DESC_VEC (0x00B4) is pointing to a memory location that contains the default Cypress device descriptor (I checked with gdb). So basically there are all the default values for device descriptor/configuration descriptor/string descriptor, and then I call susb_init( SIE1, USB_FULL_SPEED );, and on my windows XP box, it pops up as ""unknown device"" with 0x000 for VID and PID.  From my understanding of the documentation, that should absolutely, 100% work. I'm completely stumped and would be grateful for any kind of advice, be it a direct answer, or just pointing me to a resource that can help me solve the problem. Some things that could be wrong, i guess, are configuration settings of some kind (like in fwxconfig.h or usb.c or fwxmain.c or something?) or some issue with this CY7C67300 chip in a different development board than the ones included with the CY3663 development kit. I have spent the last 2 days futzing around in all those files, but couldn't get anything different to happen. I also tried making having it run from EEPROM instead of being sent over the USB with GDB, but that didn't change anything.  I've looked through all the knowledge base articles relating to the CY3663, as well as read all the documentation to the best of my abilities (I am a complete neophyte at this), so please don't just tell me to look there, unless you know of a specific thing that I overlooked.

A DSP was sending data, through a static memory port, to EP6. Then, the cypress firmware was programmed to copy that data to EP2 at which point the DSP would read that data, from EP2, and EP2 would get emptied. The problem was that, because this was an internal loopback with no usage of the USB domain and host side, the empty flag and byte count for EP6 was not getting decreased after data was copied from EP6 to EP2. Therefore, EP6 is always growing and eventually it will get filled up. Is there some method of having the 8051 set the EP6 empty flag get set to 0 once EP6 gets copied to EP2 ?

I'm sure there will be a 100 more questions, and I'm open to all input, advise and suggestions you might have!","Show Less","Anonymous","","","2009/8/9","364","0","2","","","","","","","","","","",""

The external master continues to write an arbitrary number of bytes (say, 12), before deasserting SLWR.

At least, I think it's strange based on how I've seen WaitForXfer used in the code examples. Also, the documentation doesn't give much in the way of details.","","","","In my program, I'm trying to read a continuous stream of data from a bulk endpoint using the queued overlapped-transfer methodology provided in the Screamer example code (see the code's XferThread, LockNLoad and XferData methods). In fact, I haven't changed much in that section of the code, except for adding a wait loop at the WaitForXfer call and writing the incoming data to file every one cycle through the queue.","","Is my understanding of WaitForXfer's intended behavior correct?","My problem is that WaitForXfer always returns FALSE, meaning it has timed-out waiting for the OS to signal that the requested data has arrived. This is wrong, because I can see in USBlyzer (a sniffer program) that the requests are going out on the USB (from the preceding BeginDataXfer calls) and that the expected data is arriving from the device. My program sits in a loop, calling WaitForXfer multiple times and waiting for it to return TRUE, so that the program might proceed to call FinishDataXfer and write the data to a file. Even though the data has already come in, WaitForXfer never indicates its presence (seems to me that it should), and so my program stays in the wait loop. I'm giving WaitForXfer a reasonable timeout of 500ms. Since CyUSB is a black-box, I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this any further.","Can anyone provide some insight into what the problem might be?","I'm using Windows XP and SuiteUSB 2.0.",""

I want to keep the modifications to this old system to a minimum. If that means using an older driver source that doesn't need the ""hash_algo_name"" symbol or hash_info module, then that is fine by me. If there is a way to compile the latest driver so that it doesn't have any need for the hash_info module, that is also fine by me. Whatever it takes to get a newer driver on the system that doesn't have the issue I keep running into randomly.","Any insight is appreciated!","backports github","To summarize, I got the 4.14.79 kernel source, set variables, and compiled the kernel image just fine. When trying to build the backports package for the modules, I run into issues. The first time I tried building the kernel image, I simply put the variables in the console (did not add them explicitly to .config) and ran into a problem with 'regdb_has_valid_signature' and ""implicit declaration of function 'verify_pkcs7_signature'"". The second time around I explicitly added the variables to .config and everything went smooth. However, when trying to insert the compat.ko module, I get a message about ""Unknown symbol in module"" and dmesg says ""Unknown symbol hash_algo_name (err 0)"". Now, as far as I can tell that module does not exist on my system (cat /proc/kallsyms | grep hash_algo_name and hash_info both return nothing) and I don't know how to get around it.","","7.45.98.38 (r674442CY) FWID 01-e58d219f","","https://community.infineon.com/html/@4F31C10E63A8DEAD5447F4ACE23F9B35/badge_icons/Login_1.svg"

Expected would be that the USB PD negotiation fails and therefore the SAFE_PWR_EN should control the 5V out and connect the VBUS (which I measured also in this scenario at 5V) to the 5V output. But instead the SAFE_PWR_EN pin is high and therefore there is no 5V out.This is not acceptable from a usability perspective. So what is a possible fix for this? Would it maybe work to add 5.1K resistors to the CC1 and CC2 lines? Or would this interfere with the USB-PD IC? Or should I connect the D+ and D- lines of the USB-PD IC with the USB-C port? But wouldn't this interfere with a USB to serial IC (CP2102N) which is curently connected to the D+ and D- lines of my pcb?","","","","","","","","","","https://community.infineon.com/html/@DB310C00FCF7164DF57F5E9E38A34695/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_1.svg"

My output shall be 28V. The 1st supply should deliver 200W and the 2nd supply should deliver 400W. I was first considering the LLC topology with ICE2HS01G-DS but after going into some reference material, found that EMI will be a problem later on due to the varying frequency of the converter. I therefore am considering a forward converter topology with an active clamp. I want to use the same topology for both designs in order to re-use circuitry and minimize risk. I came across the XDPP1100 digital power controller but what I would like to verify is whether the choice of topology and controller is in fact the optimum choice. I am not space constraint but my operating temperature will be at a maximum of 65 deg C, so efficiency is critical. I do not have forced air to cool down my design so I will have to rely on conduction cooling. Some inputs or advice will be greatly appreciated.","Show Less","Gualbertm","https://community.infineon.com/html/@5314BCBE1A8075802F557371685FC5CB/badge_icons/Login_5.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@DB310C00FCF7164DF57F5E9E38A34695/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_1.svg","2024/4/15","158","0","3","","","","","","","","","","","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BB7CBF68EA79EE2CE80785E7E8F100B7/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_1.svg"
