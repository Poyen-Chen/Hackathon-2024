(In LTSpice, the MOSFET was already present in the library after I installed it). In the circuit, I guessed the values of turn on gate resistance, and turn off gate resistance, but I am not sure these are ok. Should I just use one resistance in the gate with a value of RG = 1.6 Ohm? I am asking because the switching loss loss that I measure on LTspice on Mosfet M1 results about twice as big compared to the switching loss on M1 I calculated using the method described in the 2006 Infineon application note I stated above. Note that in the circuit below, I specified VDD = 75 V, VGS = 10V, ID = 100A like in the MOSFET datasheet .","Finally, my objective would be to use LT spice to confirm that the switching loss calculation I made according to the 2006 Infineon application note are correct, or at least in the right ball park.

When conducting circuit testing, I set the VCC of AUIR3242STRXUMA1 to 12V and connected a 10 ohm resistor to the MOS. When setting the IN of AUIR3242STRXUMA1 to 3.3V, its VOUT reached 24V. But when IN is set to 0V, VOUT will become 14V, and the GATE and SOURCE pin will be short circuited, making B2BMOS unable to ON. After reviewing the manual, I found that the undervoltage protection was triggered in AUIR3242STRXUMA1. What is the reason for this? It is because the added load current is not enough, causing the MOS to operate in the linear region？","","","","","",""

The circuit is as follows: CH3 (upper tube) and CH4 (lower tube) conduct at the same time, CH2 is the lower tube of the other set of bridges do not conduct at this time. The effect on the Vgs signal of the lower CH2 (off) is verified by the dv/dt generated at the corresponding node when the upper CH3 is on. The load is purely resistive.","So there are a couple questions I need to ask:","Is there a finite value for the duration corresponding to the transient voltage of Vgs of IMYH200R075M1H? For example, if the duration of Vgs >10V is greater than 100ns, the MOSFET will be damaged.","When the bus voltage is about 950V, the test results are as follows: the blue color is the Vgs signal of the lower tube of CH2, and the purple color is the current signal of IR. From the figure, we can see that the negative voltage of Vgs turns off CH2, and during the simultaneous conduction of CH3 and CH4, Vgs receives a spike due to the influence of dv/dt, with a positive spike peak of about 7.5V and a negative spike peak of about 10V.","The driver circuit diagram is shown above.","Vgs signal test circuit diagram as above.","According to the IMYH200R075M1H datasheet its Vgs cannot exceed -10V while its conduction threshold is about 3.6V."

I use 4 IRF100B201 Mosfets per switch for my inverter. The gates are isolated and switched with +-15 V. The gate resistance is 10 Ohms. I perform a U-turn with 20 A and measure the drain-source voltage of the high-side and low-side Mosfets. I measure negative drain-source voltages ranging from 6.9 to 11 V and am now concerned that my Mosfets may break down when increasing the current. Currently, I use a BLDC motor as a load with a stator resistance of 20 mOhm and 1uH, but I intend to switch to a stronger motor with a stator resistance of 2 mOhm and 68 uH. Could there be a measurement error here, or what would be the next steps to increase performance?","","","","","",""

Initially, I tried parallelizing two IRF520NPBF, but the operation was highly unstable, and temperatures soared, eventually leading to the MOSFETs burning out. Subsequently, I attempted to replace them with IRFP150NPBF, which has a higher current rating and better heat dissipation, but encountered discrepancies in startup voltage and gain between them, resulting in continued instability. Finally, in my search, I found that the parameters of 2SK1058 meet my requirements. It's a negative temperature coefficient type, but unfortunately, 2SK1058 has been discontinued.","So, I'd like to ask if any of you have similar experiences to share. Thank you!","","","",""

I am using a Tektronix rogowski coil and HV diff probe on the FET. The parameters are an 800V bus, 8uH inductor, and a 1 us pulse to produce roughly 100A. The gate drivers go between -3 and 15V, and the gate resistance is 1 Ohm.  I am getting  1.9mJ instead of the low hundreds of uJ expected from the datasheet.","","The datasheet also lists Efr the ""forward recovery"" energy. I'm not familiar with this term but based on the reverse recovery, is it the energy that the diode expends when switching on? Then would it be measured in the DPT? Should I add the Efr and Eoff together?","","",""

I'm learning to create SiC matrix for voltage and current control, where I'm trying to generate 200ns square pulses. I'm controlling 9 SiC devices to generate these pulses on a load, 3 by 3 configuration. Each SiC has a Vds of 900 V and a current of around ten amperes. I can generate perfect pulses, but when I increase my load voltage beyond 1500 V up to 2000 V (the limit of my switch), I notice an undershoot at the beginning of the pulse, as if my control signal drops to 0 for a few ns. I've attached a signal measurement for clarity. I'm using a driver for each SiC. The driver is not from the Infineon brand (UCC27614) for the simple reason that I'm not sure how to choose it, so I didn't go for the best option  I'm using SiCs from another brand, but I plan to use IMBG120R060M1HXTMA1 to increase voltage once I resolve the issues with my switch. Having no experience, my questions are: What are the best drivers for matrixing and fast switching (front lower than 10 ns)? Are there articles or reviews that provide guidance on how to design a PCB effectively? Should I protect the control trace between layers connected to ground to avoid disturbances? Should I add filters to protect the driver or for other purposes?","Show Less","EBRUNE","https://community.infineon.com/html/@5D4E593E0A030CD78DB8D5CDDA2554E1/badge_icons/Likes%20received_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@DB310C00FCF7164DF57F5E9E38A34695/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BB7CBF68EA79EE2CE80785E7E8F100B7/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_1.svg","2023/11/7","422","1","5","Thank you in advance.","","","","","",""

I only have basic knowledge so the identification of MOSFET has come from someone else. The picture explains what I have found out when the board is live at 240V. I am reasonably sure the MOSFET is broken as I accidentally shorted two of the pins with my meter and scared the living daylights out of myself as the motor burst into life. As there are no markings, I am going to have to make an educated guess on replacing it so need to know the variables. The obvious ones are 240V and a minimum 6.25 A continuous load. Do I upgrade amps to take care of start up load? RDS has been suggested as 0.005  or less is that correct? Finding places to buy low-quantity items has also been a challenge any suggestions please?  If anyone has a part number, that would make you my favourite person of the year. Anything you can do to help will be greatly appreciated.","Show Less","Billysmart","https://community.infineon.com/html/@DB310C00FCF7164DF57F5E9E38A34695/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BB7CBF68EA79EE2CE80785E7E8F100B7/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@4F31C10E63A8DEAD5447F4ACE23F9B35/badge_icons/Login_1.svg","2023/9/4","490","0","3","","","","","","",""

We would appreciate a quick response.","","Which MOSFET controller do you recommend to use with this MOSFET?. The load of the MOSFET will be a RF power MMIC with a supply voltage of 24V and maximum power consumption around 5 A. We will have two MMICs and I think that each one will be supplied with each MOSFET of the two units inside this component.","I would need to test the time response behaviour of the RF power MMIC. Would it be possible to adquire an evaluation board of the previous MOSFET?

Recently we had three returned with similar failures, one of the fuel injector driver outputs had failed on each. Each of the failures was on a different channel - there are eight channels total in the ECU. The output transistor is an IRLR3705ZPBF that is a low-side driver - the injector has battery voltage on one side and this output switches the other side to ground to turn it on. The only other related component is a current sense resistor between the transistor source and ground. The three failures are similar in that the output is 'stuck' on - the transistor flows enough current that the injector remains on all the time. With no power on the unit, measuring between the output pin (transistor drain) and ground gives a low resistance - two were in the range of 3K ohm while the third was 235 ohms (on a normal channel, the resistance is very high). Unfortunately, these units are potted, so I can't make any other checks. The question is... based on this very limited information (low resistance), is there any indication regarding the cause of the failure? For example, I've seen power MOSFETs fail with nearly a direct short due to over-current, but these resistances are much higher than that. Besides, the output has current monitoring and shuts off when over-currented - my testing indicates that this works. Of the other failure modes, do any generally result in a 'partially' shorted condition? Thanks, Dave.","Show Less","PEDave","https://community.infineon.com/html/@DB310C00FCF7164DF57F5E9E38A34695/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BB7CBF68EA79EE2CE80785E7E8F100B7/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@4F31C10E63A8DEAD5447F4ACE23F9B35/badge_icons/Login_1.svg","2023/8/7","500","0","3","","","","","","",""

I very much look forward to getting your response.(1)In the example of EVAL_2ED020I12-F2, part of the schematic diagram is shown in Figure 3-3. The values of D2B and D3B are BAT165, and they are Schottky diodes after checking. But why are they drawn as zener diodes? (2) Also in Figure 3-3, C3B is important in desaturation protection. In the example of EVAL_2ED020I12-F2, 2ED020I12-F2 is used to drive IGBT-IKP20N60H3, whose short circuit withstand time is 5 μs when VGE = 15V. Is the short circuit response time calculated as ""Vdesat/Idesatc*C3B + Tdesatleb +Tdesatout = 9V/500μA*220pF + 400ns + 350ns = 4.71 μs"" ? Then, since 4.71 μs is less than 5 μs, the design of C3B is reasonable. My question is, is the value of 220pF for C3B still reasonable when I use 2ED020I12-F2 to drive SiC Mosfet instead of IGBT? For example, when the short circuit withstand time of a certain type of SiC Mosfet is 3 μs, should the value of C3B be changed to 110pF so that the short circuit response time is 2.73μs? (3) Also in Figure 3-3, RG1B and RG2B are designed to be 100 Ω, are their resistances too high? In the datasheet of IKP20N60H3, the recommended gate resistance is 14.6Ω.","Show Less","Desheng_Zhang","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BBEC66922B1C4B9B7C6B587E96E232D8/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_5.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@4845BE2359674DBCE16B5A976BD412C8/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_5.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@9FC46A0208CA612D6CB0C9007C71D09A/badge_icons/Login_10.svg","2023/4/20","393","0","2","","","","","","",""

The capacitor is connected to the gates of several parallel MOSFETs. As the capacitor charges, the voltage seen on the gate (to the source) ramps down until the capacitor is fully charged. At this gate voltage, the MOSFET is in the saturation region. The problem I am facing, is that the hot swap circuit is designed to dissipate power across the temporary load for several seconds. During this time, the gate voltage transitions from 0V to over the the Vth limit, pushing the MOSFET into the Ohmic region for several seconds. For several seconds, the gate voltage is below the zero temperature coefficient point specified on the MOSFET, which I believed is causing thermal runaway and destroying the device. Is there a best practice circuit design that can be used to avoid damaging the MOSFET device during long time instances (approximately 10 s) in the Ohmic region of the MOSFET?","","","","","",""

For this topology at lite load and high input voltage the switching frequency sweep is  220kHz to 470kHz during input line cycle. We hoped that replacing common MOSFET with SiC (Infineon IMBG65R107M1H) will improve efficiency. The datasheet for IMBG65R107M1H says that it is compatible with standard drivers. We simulated this circuit with Infineon Spice models and it shows that power losses should be 1W less if using SiC IMBG65R107M1H.

The mosfet I am using is Infineon-BSC034N10LS5. I tried to decrease the gate resistance but it was of no use. I tried to use another MOSFET IRL520NPbF and the waveform is totally normal. But after checking the datasheets of these two MOSFETs. I notice that the total gate charge are 37nC and 20nC and the gate to source charge are 14nC and 4.6nC, the charge value of BSC034N10LS5 is only 2~3 times of that for IRL520NPbF. So why the waveform of these two devices can be so much different?","PS: when I tested the driving circuit with IRL520NPbF, I simply connected the device to the circuit. When I tested with BSC034N10LS5, I did on a PCB with the MOSFET connected with other elements, but I am pretty sure the other circuit is open circuit. I think it will not affect the result.","","",""

We have roughly 65 boards in existence with 9 instances of BSC100N06LS3GATMA1 and 3 instances of BSC067N06LS3GATMA1 on each board. This circuit has never had a single problem until our last run of 14 boards. These 14 boards had very minor part changes from the previous iteration, but none of which would have had any affect on this circuit as these are all in an isolated design. They do run flying probe testing after PCBA, and they reported that it passed that test.","Show Less","kparrent","https://community.infineon.com/html/@8D0CEDDB2B2BA0125F60F1F756154B75/badge_icons/Likes%20given_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@DB310C00FCF7164DF57F5E9E38A34695/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BB7CBF68EA79EE2CE80785E7E8F100B7/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_1.svg","2022/11/22","417","0","6","On these 14 boards, we had 3 boards with a failure with at least one of these parts which we could narrow down to four MOSFETs. Based on electrical waveform analysis it appeared to be an issue in the power stage of the design so I requested X-Rays on these MOSFETs and the controller IC. After reviewing the X-Rays it looked to me like there was possibly excess solder voiding which was maybe limiting current transmission. The application is a 5A/48VDC output buck DC/DC which is only dropping the input voltage by roughly 5V. 250W of output is required. I am not an expert in solder void analysis and would like additional opinions from the community on that. Those X-Rays are attached here- note that the vias under the pad are filled with resin.","I asked the assembler to remove those parts, clean them, and replace them to see if it fixed the issue, and it did in fact correct the issue on the first board. We have two more that I also suspect it will correct it, but I have asked him to hold off on reworking until we can come up with an isolation procedure to verify the root cause.","I asked the assembler to supply more information about the source of the parts and the storage. The BSC067N06LS3GATMA1 parts were received from a broker due to supply shortages, and they were not received or stored in moisture sealed packaging. Upon observation under a microscope they believe they saw oxidation on the leads of one of the unused parts. That picture is included as an attachment. The BSC100N06LS3GATMA1 were received from Mouser and were stored appropriately.","Which is more likely to be the issue? The first experiment of removing the issue and manually replacing would have also cleaned the oxidation off of the parts. I also don't generally feel like for just the small current we are talking about on these that the solder voiding is extreme enough to cause the issue. This is not a finger pointing exercise- it is simply trying to understand and prevent issues on upcoming builds.","","",""

For example, Co(tr) was determined by loading the output capacitance from 0 to 500V, but the voltage level used is only 300V.","This is my understanding of Co(tr):The fixed capacitance Co(tr) is used to capture the relationship between charge and voltage of the discontinuous output capacitance. Here, the equivalent capacitance Co(tr) is determined by charging the output capacitance at a current i and a voltage V, and thus describes the time-related effective output capacitance. Thus, Co(tr) can be used to determine the charge/discharge time of the output capacitance Coss independent of the topology.","Best regards","","",""

Especially when splitting the resonance capacitance Cr. This would apply more stress to the capacitance, but it also stabilizes the input dc-link voltage more. Additionally it would prevent incomplete body diode reverse recovery, which can damage the power FET due to large current caused by the high reverse recovery charge.Therefore it seems that the HB-LLC is the more reliable and more forgiving topology.","The FB-LLC has the main advantage that it uses the whole input voltage Vin, when the HB-LLC only uses half of it Vin/2.  This reduces the current stress on the components in the FB-LLC.  Due to the lower current and the two more switches the heat dissipation would be less and more distributed.With a combination of phase-shifting and frequency variation the input voltage range of the FB-LLC can be increased.. [1]","The formulas also indicate that a smaller Cr and Lm is needed in the FB-LLC, while the Lr gets bigger. This would decrease the resonance circuit, but the bridge would get bigger and more expensive due to the higher component count.","","[1]","Best regards"

I'm using a driving strength of ~250 mA, which would seem to be ok.Do you have any insight?Thanks,Federico","Show Less","User16986","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BB7CBF68EA79EE2CE80785E7E8F100B7/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_1.svg","","","2019/4/23","2878","0","1","","","","","","",""

And I am going to use one of Infenion's SiC-Mosfet power module (62mm) (1.2kV and 500A).","As you can also see from figure, what I attached below, SRC consists of two H-Bridges, one operates in inverter-mode to supply square wave Voltage across LC-resonant tank and the other one operates in synchronous rectifier mode. In 2. H-bridge (synchronous rectification) there is a negative current flowing through the switches (reverse current), which is indicated as 3rd quadrant operation of the MOSFET in datasheets. Both H-bridges switches synchronous. So the switches in 2nd H-Bridge (synchronous rectification) are switched-on and -off while negative current flowing through them. Which means that current will flow through the body diode and the MOS-Channel of the MOSFET. Therefore I expect that there will be switching losses.","By using the related figures with 3rd quadrant operation one can approximately calculate the conduction losses, but there are no information or publication about switching losses during 3rd quad operation!","My question is, would switching losses arise in 3rd quadrant operation ? if yes what would be the characteristic of it (same as first quadrant switching losses)?","","",""

This is a half bridge (part of a 3 phase bridge) with IPT015N10 MOSFETs and 2EDL23N gate drivers, with 2.2R resistors on the gate.I am running ~600ns dead time, and have verified (actually on another thread on the gate driver forum, that there is a peak of about 1A into the FETs gates. The switching looks really nice. I started investigating this only because it turns out my dead time was too short (accidentally set the dead time at 178ns owing to programming whoopsie)When designing this, I followed the appnote ""Parasitic Turn-on of Power MOSFET – How to avoid it?"":From this, I ascertained that the parasitic gate bounce witha  75V DC bus would be given roughly by:75V*Crss/(Ciss-Crss)=75*80pF/(12000pF-80pF) = 0.5VThe ratio CGS/CGD is 150, which for a 75V rail, and by analogy to the appnote statement "" is completelysafe against parasitic turn-on""The problem is as in the pics below:Ringing on the gate traceThis is how I am probing the gate - can't really think how to get a better measurement than this...This clearly shows that the gate bounce at the switching event is much higher than the calculation from the appnote shows. There is no current flowing (nothing attached to the switch node) so this isn't intuitively inductive coupling, and probing the gate driver side of the gate resistor shows a lower amount of bounce, by approximately 1/3 - the ratio I would expect given the 2.2R resistor and the ~5ohm driver pull down impedance.The gate driver has a very solid ground path between the PGnd and the FET source, a plane with the gate trace routed through it There is a ground plane directly below it. This is taken on the low side FET.So the question is: Why am I getting this amount of bounce? Pretty much 10x as much as the appnote calculates I should get. Is it real, or is there some other explanation I am missing?Further question: Is this a problem? It's only a 25ns wide blip, maybe that is so short that the effect is negligible?Further question: If it is a problem, what should I do about it? I chose these FETs because they looked completely safe against parasitic turn on, I don't really want to go down the route of generating negative gate drive voltages etc, since this would eliminate my use of the 2EDL's over current protection and generally involve a lot more board space.","Show Less","User17346","https://community.infineon.com/html/@802D173B6CCE19D70A765EC56856B0C4/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_10.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@4845BE2359674DBCE16B5A976BD412C8/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_5.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BBEC66922B1C4B9B7C6B587E96E232D8/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_5.svg","2021/2/21","7827","0","8","","https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Parasitic_Turn-on_of_Power_MOSFET.pdf?fileId=db3a30431ed1d7b2011eee756cee5475","","","","",""

Based on the ratings, FF23MR12W1M1P_B11 looks like a good fit. However, the datasheet does not provide much information. Edit: I think we misunderstood the definition of SOA. So the title of this post does not reflect our question.If we are not running the mosfet at saturaton zone, we don't nee to care about it, right? If I am correct, then our main concern is just the current limit of this module. Based on our current design, the mosfet will be switched on and off at 700V (maximum) with a peak current at the AC output will be 62A which is beyond the 50A rating of the module.I know that the 50A rating is a limit when Tvj is 175C, and the RMS current through mosfet should be between 30A and 35A. But we are not sure if the device can handel a peak current at 62A when the junction temperature is below 125C.Can you please comment on the feasibility of such use of FF23MR12W1M1P_B11?Also, what is the temperature TH in the datasheet: ""DC drain current   Tvj=175C, VGS=15V    TH=80C  ID,non   50A"".

The switching times (Tdon, Tr, Tdoff and Tf) are defined in relation with the collector current (Ice).For the MOSFETs (such as SiC MOSFETs), a resistive load is used for the test. The switching times are defined in relation with the drain source voltage (Vds).My questions are:Why do  we prefer an inductive load for IGBTs? Why the switching times are not measured in relation with the collector voltage (Vce) ?Why do we always use a resitive load for SiC MOSFET? Can the switching times be defined by the drain current (Ids) or they need to be defined by the drain voltage (Vds) ?For the context: I need to determine the minimum dead time for two power converters, one made of SiC MOSFETs and the second one made of IGBTs.Thanks in advance","Show Less","User19230","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BB7CBF68EA79EE2CE80785E7E8F100B7/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_1.svg","","","2020/3/24","9094","0","1","","","","","","",""

I'm left with a trace of around 4mm for the source. On a 2oz/ft^2 board, if I let the trace heat up 60°C over ambient I might be able to pass 25A. Nowhere near the transistors ability to handle 100A DC. On other packages, like D2PAK I'm able to solder wires on top of the trace so that it can handle more current, but with DirectFET I have an area covered by the transistor itself where I can not add any wires.

I expect that when HIN is ON for 100ms, that vgate1 should stay ON for 100ms (time depends on bootstrap cap). But when using 1K R6,R8 gate stays opened for short time as it is drained away very quickly.- When there is no load, high side MOSFET source is charged from VS and vgate1 compensate so that MOSFET VGS stayes at 0V. Is this expected behavior? If so, I do not like that VCC is leaking into high voltage circuit (bridge). Is there a way to prevent this? I would expect that when IR2110 powers ON and no load is present (all gates in bridge is closed) that all gates should be at 0V and no voltage is present on VOUT1.Regards, Boris Makovecki","Show Less","Anonymous","","","","2017/9/10","9682","0","2","","","","","","",""

All these tools are powered by LiPo 18V nominal 20.5V max removable batteries and operate with the IRLB3813 as a PWM'd switch to ground (i.e. not a bridge). A new tool is presenting a problem with IRLB3813s failing upon battery insertion. These failures can be on the first insertion, or sometimes will not happen many hundreds of insertions or more. The difference in this tool design is that the motor leads are 42cm of 14AWG - considerably longer than the earlier design where the motor leads were 10cm or less. What appears to happen is that the IRLB3813 bursts into oscillation perhaps due to parasitics in the motor leads. The pcb layout is clean with a robust power and ground plane. For transient suppression a 4A schottky diode clamps the drain to the +battery and the battery bus is shunted by a 24V TVS diode. When the failure occurs a brief period of RF oscillation - somewhere around a millisecond - causes the IRLB3813 to permanently ""short"" at around 10 ohms. When operating properly, the gate drive is a crisp and clean 15V 2KHz PWM signal and the IRLB3813 handles the 500W load staying nice and cool in the process. My working hypothesis is that the IRLB3813 maximum Vds of 30V isn't quite large enough to handle these oscillations and as a result the device breaks down. One may think that the schottky would clamp this voltage but resonance(s) in the battery may limit that clamping. I am planning to run tests with a higher voltage FET, the IRFB7437. Any feedback or suggestions would be welcome.","Show Less","Anonymous","","","","2017/8/22","4176","0","2","","","","","","",""

If drain current is statics (DC), simulation perfectly match datasheet (see Fig1 and Fig2).But , if drain current changes, Rdson changes very much. Fig3 shows sinusoidal Current applied to MOSFET drain, while gate is kept at 12V DC voltage. As can be seen from this picture, at the beginning of the wave when current is small,  Rdson is much higher than nominal value and it is dropping. At the top of sinusoidal wave Rdson stays relatively constant. When drain current  starts dropping , Rdson drops and even becomes negative!

I've set-up the standard de-bounce sketch on my board no problem and have had a mess around with a few other sketches, BUT I'm having trouble envisaging a way of controlling this ground from the arduino.The mosfet uses a 24v dc source, and the arduino 5v, common ground. Any time this ground is plugged into the uno board pins it automatically turns on the mosfet. I'm assuming that the pins are pulled to ground. Turning on the switch using the de-bounce sketch has no effect as I guess this only raises the gnd input pin to 5v and the mosfet remains on.So, can someone give me some guidance on a direction for this project?The datasheet is folloling link:","Show Less","Anonymous","","","","2017/3/6","3707","0","1","","https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-BTS50055_1TMA-DS-v01_01-en.pdf?fileId=db3a3043183a95550118607dca6c36c1","","","","",""

Particularly I am a bit puzzled withAs far as I see there is a mismatch between input parameters for MOSFETs dynamic losses calculations and parameters given in datasheets.According to Fig.6 on page 7 of [1] in hard switching mode the time is the interval where the drain current of turning-on MOSFET rises from near zero to load current, while is the interval where the drain current falls during turn-off. These dynamic parameters are used for losses calculation, and as indicated on Fig.7 (and commented in the text on page 6) can be read from a device datasheet (as the worst-case values).However, as I see inthey represent absolutely different values. According to Fig.31 of this document (page 29) is the voltage fall time during turn-on (90% to 10%) while is the voltage rise time durin turn-off (10% to 90%). The same definitions are given on page 13 (Table 20) inIn my opinion, these two parameters given in datasheets are not relevant to whose indicated in calculation losses strategy.May be it is because in IGBT datasheets is defined as the collector current rise time during turn-on and  is defined as the collector current fall time during turn-off. For example, IGBT case is shown on page 15 inI come to the conclusion, that the calculation strategy in [1] does not distinguish differences between dynamic characteristics, given in MOSFET datasheets, and dynamic characteristics, given in IGBT datasheets.Could you, please, explain whether I am right or not and why.Also, I would be grateful if you can provide other documentation for switching losses calculation for Infineon MOSFETs.All the documents [1-4] are attached in this letter.","Show Less","Anonymous","","","","2014/5/31","25658","0","2","[1] Graovac D., Purschel M., Kiep A.

I had several errors when trying to import this component. Is there any steps of instructions to import Infineon model into Orcad? Did anyone have this issue before and how can we solve it? each time I get one of these two errors (although both of them were defined in edit simulation-->library): 1) ERROR -- Can't find nomd.lib2) error(orpsim-16276): can't find library .libThe name of the file that has this library is very long and it has many characters. I thought that might be an issue too so I changed it to a simpler name and in this case the previous two errors were gone but I got another different type of errors (attached).Please advice.","Show Less","Anonymous","","","","2014/11/19","12368","0","1","","","","","","",""
