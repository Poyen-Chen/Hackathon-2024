It is targeted at USB PD charger adapters for applications such as smartphones and mobile computers with wide input range and wide output voltage range. The figure below shows the top view of the complete board system, consisting of the main power supply board, the VCC daughter board and the EPR board. The AC input connections are X1 and X2 in the lower left corner, while the board output is the Type-C connector in the upper right corner.","1.1 AC input power supply specifications","1.2 Output power supply specifications","1.3 Main devices","1.4 Development Board PCB Information","2. Introduction to board-level systems","The system consists of a main power board, a VCC supply board, and a USD PD EPR 28 V daughter board.Both the PFC and HFB stages are controlled by one of Infineon's XDP ™digital controllers, the combination controller XDP ™ XDPS2221. On the output side, Infineon's USB PD EZ-PD ™controller CCG3PA CYPD3175 is used for communication with end devices and output voltage management. In the following subsections, the schematics of these boards are presented, and for the bill of materials (BOM) of the boards, see the subsequent series.","2.1 Main power board","The schematic and PCB layout of the motherboard are shown in the following figure. Unassembled parts are shown in gray in the schematic.","The figure above shows the power supply circuitry for the AC input and PFC stages, including input protection and EMI filters (RV100, CX100, RX100, RX101, LC100, D100, CB100, CB191, LD100, LD101, CB102, and CB103), as well as the starting battery external circuitry (D101, D102. R100, R101, and R102).The PFC zero-crossing detection (ZCD) and current sense (CS) signals are combined into a single signal, PFCzcdcs, which is connected to IC pin PFCCS.The voltage of the PFC auxiliary winding, which is coupled to the PFC main inductor (T100), is determined by the devices R103, D103, D105, R104 C100, D104, Z100, C101, and R105 are processed to generate the ZCD signal, where D103 is used for negative clamping and networks D104, Z100, C101, and R105 limit the positive voltage of the ZCD signal. The ZCD signal is effectively decoupled from the PFC CS resistors R111, R112 and R114 through resistor R109, which provide the CS signal to the control IC.The CoolGaN ™device is used as the PFC main switch, Q100, which is directly driven by the XDP ™ XDPS2221 from the PFCGD pin with external RC networks (R107, R106 and C102). Note: The devices shown in gray in the schematic are not assembled on the board. In addition, some 0 Ω resistors have been prepared to allow easy component selection.","The HFB is based on a half-bridge structure as shown above. The main winding of transformer T200 is connected to the half-bridge switching node at one end and to the resonant capacitors (C201 to C223) at the other end. Shunt resistors (R211, R212) are used to sense the current through the main winding of the transformer for HFB peak current regulation. For precise switching timing, a signal from the auxiliary winding (Vaux1) is used. It uses devices R205, R206, R204 and a small filter capacitor C203 to generate a ZCD signal. Resistors R200, R201, R202 and R203 are used for PFC voltage sensing. Both voltages from the auxiliary windings Aux1 and Aux2 are supplied to the VCC daughter board via connector M200.The JP200 connector is used for parameter configuration via UART communication.","","The following figure shows the schematic of the half-bridge, including the gate RC network driving the GaN switch.","On the secondary side, the output voltage is rectified by a synchronous rectifier circuit, while the USB PD daughter board controls the reference voltage of the shunt regulator (D202) and thus the output voltage.The schematic diagram of the SR daughter board is shown in the following figure.","","To keep the system cost low, all boards use a two-layer PCB. the following two diagrams show the PCB layout of the motherboard.","2.2 VCC Power Board","At cold start, the VCC supply is provided through a resistor connected to the HV pin. The charging current is controlled by the starting battery. During normal operation, the VCC supply is ensured by the VCC daughter board. The following figure shows the schematic of the VCC board.","Show Less","https://community.infineon.com/i/rank_icons/admin.gif","Translation_Bot","2024/3/23","330","0","0","","","https://community.infineon.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/100770i5D4B038538A19E86/image-size/medium?v=v2&px=400","https://community.infineon.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/100772iD02FE9B903B6D080/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999","https://community.infineon.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/100773i42829F816CEBFFE6/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999","https://community.infineon.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/100774i1236838339B681A2/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999","The VCC supply circuit is based on the charge pump concept. According to this concept, the IC supply is coupled to the HFB input voltage but independent of the wide range output voltage. Two auxiliary windings are implemented for efficient VCC generation. At high HFB input voltage, energy is transferred from Vaux1, while at low HFB input voltage, Vaux2 is used.The PCB design of the board is shown below.","2.3 EPR boards","The EPR board is based on the EZ-PD ™controller CYPD3175, as shown below","A linear regulator (G1) is used to generate the required supply voltage for the controller CYPD3175. A circuit consisting of Q2, Q2A, D2, D3, R3 and R11 provides the required voltage on the communication lines CC1 and CC2. The controller CYPD3175 senses the input voltage Vco (VBUS_IN from the perspective of the EPR board) and the output voltage (VBUS_OUT), where the output voltage of the Type-C connector is ""on"" or ""off"" controlled by the load switch Q6. The output current of the Type-C connector is sensed by shunt resistors R17 and R18, filtered by elements R19 and C7, and then sent to the PD controller IC. The controller CYPD3175 communicates with the end device via communication lines CC1 and CC2, sets the output voltage level of the HFB accordingly via the signal PDFB, and controls the supply to the end device via load switch Q6. device. For output voltage drop transitions, the PD controller may activate the bus discharge paths (R4, Q3 and R2, Q5) before and after the safety switch. The PCB layout of the EPR board is shown in the figure below.","","",""
