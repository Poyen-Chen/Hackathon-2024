Currently i am utilizing a TVS diode (ESD101-B1-02 Series) shunted to ground for this. Based on my understanding, a TVS diode shunted to ground should clamp at the Maximum Working Voltage (Vrwm) and ESD101-B1-02 series has Vrwm of +/- 5.5V. So using the Power to voltage conversion table, a Vp of 5.5 should clamp at around 25dBm. However , when i used a signal generator to pump ++26dBm to it, i noticed that it doesn't clamp at 25dBm. I think my understanding is wrong and maybe it's the clamping voltage that i should refer to ? Appreciate help on this.","Also, what would be the best way to utilise diodes for RF power clamps at 26dBm. Would stacking multiple anti-parallel diodes work?"
