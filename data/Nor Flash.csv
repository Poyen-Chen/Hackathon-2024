For read and write operations, I am using the QSPI mode. Based on my code, the flash seems to be working properly, and there don't appear to be any issues with the QSPI line. I am confident that everything is fine, and I am making good progress with my work.","However, while I was performing various operations such as writing, reading, erasing, and reading the device ID, I didn't receive any response from the Flash. I cannot recall the exact sequence of operations I performed. Despite my efforts, the Flash did not respond to these commands. At this point, I decided to replace the Flash IC with a new one of the same type, and it worked perfectly fine.","Could you please let me know if there is any way to corrupt the Flash?

We are interfacing it from an STM32F1 over single lane SPI.There are no special protection regimes in place, and the registers reads as default values on startup. We can write and read from the chip, and doing a Chip Erase command (0x60) resets all flash entries to 0xFF. However, issuing block erase (0xDC) or sector erase (0x21) doesn't work. The flash reads out as exactly the same as before the operation.We issue the write enable command (0x06) and polls status register 1 waiting for Write Enable Latch to set before issuing the command. After the command is issued, we poll status register 1 waiting for Work-In-Progress bit to clear. After that we also read status register 2. The chip does not report any errors in either status registers.

My board has a microchip pic 18f87j11 and I use 3 wire SPI to bit bash the flash (SI,SO and CLK). I use 16 x 1Gbit S25FL01 parts. I use assembly rather than C. My issue is that I am trying to Page Program using the 12h command (4 byte address) and then reading the data back. I Bulk Erase before each new write. (Also I use a CRO in conjunction with the microchip PICKIT3 debugger with various breakpoints to debug.)","This works ok until I reach the 128th 512 byte page, then the data bytes I read back become corrupted. I was having problems not being able to program more than 1 page and have now got around that by repeating the 12h command write before each page which seems to work fine.

The device is used just as external storage.","I don't want to erase the whole sector if I need to update just one value, so I will have to store the updated value for that variable in the next available memory location and keep doing that until I reach the end of the sector. Then copy all data from all valid addresses to the next sector and erase the previous sector. It seems too complicated for software to keep track of addresses for all variables stored in flash, and to keep updating those addresses every time when a new value is written.","The software keeps those addresses in RAM, so what to do on the next powerup.  They will all be lost. The code will not know the addresses of the data it needs to retrieve from flash on powerup. Is there a simple way of doing that, or some example of higher-level software?","","Show Less","By","mikagrubinen","https://community.infineon.com/html/@DB310C00FCF7164DF57F5E9E38A34695/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BB7CBF68EA79EE2CE80785E7E8F100B7/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@4F31C10E63A8DEAD5447F4ACE23F9B35/badge_icons/Login_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/calender.svg","2021/12/8","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/view.svg","338","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/like.svg","0","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/comment.svg","2"

I have written my own device driver implementation, supporting the FAST_READ (0x0C), PROGRAM (0x12), and SECTOR_ERASE (0xDC) commands.","All of the three commands have been demonstrated to work. However, SECTOR_ERASE command would successfully erase the sector only about 50% of the time in the current estimation.","The biggest issue is the fact that when the SECTOR_ERASE command fails, it fails silently, without raising the E_ERR flag in the SR1 register. That means that there is no way to differentiate between the successful SECTOR_ERASE and non-successful SECTOR_ERASE without reading the whole sector and checking if all the byte locations equal to 0xFF.","To show precisely how this silent failure looks like, I am providing you with a screenshot (2 parts, since the signal capture was too long to fit into one) of the signals (captured with a logic analyzer) during the execution of the sector erase sequence.

As mentioned in the data sheet the sectors are organized as per the Ordering Part Number i.e. in our case the sectors are A Hybrid of 32 * 4-KBsectors with all remaining sectors being 64KB sectors with 256B programming Buffer. But when we actually see in the Data sheet section 8.2 Flash Memory Array, we have found there are two ways that these sectors can be arranged, which are Bottom 4Kbyte or Top 4Kbyte. We wanted to know what are the factors which decides the organization of these sectors for this NOR flash chip.","Secondly, When 4P4E command sent for erasing the 4-KB sector, after the command the data sheet suggests to pass the 4byte address, in that case with this command, which of the addresses will get erased? What happens if the address passed is lies in the middle of the sector? whether it will erase 4KB size, continuing from that address or erase the 4KB sectors where the address lies?","Regards,","","Show Less","By","Shivam","https://community.infineon.com/html/@5314BCBE1A8075802F557371685FC5CB/badge_icons/Login_5.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@DB310C00FCF7164DF57F5E9E38A34695/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BB7CBF68EA79EE2CE80785E7E8F100B7/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/calender.svg","2021/1/14","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/view.svg","1169","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/like.svg","0","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/comment.svg","2"

All devices that have ""821BB437 T"" and ""0911VVF JJ"" product date codes work properly on the card. However, devices which have ""824BB509 Q"" product date code do not work properly on the same card. If I need to detail the problem, we cannot write/read 8bit of 16bit Data bus of NOR flash. We could send you a sample to investigate it. This wafer lot sequence may be problematic. We need to maintain production. Although we have a lot of this devices, we have stopped the production since the devices became obsolete.

One of the thing the fw should do is to read/write data from/to a flash, 16-pin spi memory. For my project I need to test several SPI flash brands, including Micron, Macronix and Cypress, on the same hardware. Luckily I managed to obtain some high-level drivers (i.e. drivers based on the vendor SPI driver that allow me to perform operations like erase sectors, program the flash and so on)  written for the Micron, which I easily adapted to the macronix and the Cypress S70FL01GS (3.3V) by changing a few registers.","I would now like to use the S70FS01GS (1.8V. Of course the voltage has been switched to 1.8) and I am encountering some problems since, in spite of the similar names, the access to some information is different. For example the STATUS REGISTER (0x05), which I used on the S70FL01GS to check if a write/erase operation is over, has become obsolete and was replaced by an access to register x00800000 using the ""read any register"" register (0x65). As a consequence, where in my code I have to wait for an erase operation to conclude, I replaced this function (that works correctly with Micron, Macronix and Cypress S70FL01GS):","","Show Less","By","StVe_3722716","https://community.infineon.com/html/@8D0CEDDB2B2BA0125F60F1F756154B75/badge_icons/Likes%20given_1.svg","","","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/calender.svg","2020/2/20","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/view.svg","1273","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/like.svg","0","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/comment.svg","8"

I'm looking for a drop-in replacement for the obsolescent S25FL129P which is used in a project in my company. I was considering both S25FL128S and S25FL128L for this purposes. However I found out that S25FL128S could not be used as a drop-in replacement as of the S25FL128S has a much slower Low/High Parameter Block Erase Time than the S25FL129P, which can be seen in the 64 kB Low/High Parameter Block Erase Time Test presented in the Cypress application note AN98577 ""Migration from FL-P to FL-S Family SPI Interface Flash Memories"", page 11, table 12.","","I am now exploring the possibilities of using the S25FL128L for this purpose instead. However I have not been able to find any results pertaining to Low/High Parameter Block Erase Time Test in the S25FL128L datasheet. Is this information available somewhere? I would like to ascertain whether the the FL-L devices suffer from the same issue as well or not. Thank you in advance.","","","Show Less","By","reca_4445166","","","","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/calender.svg","2019/9/5","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/view.svg","490","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/like.svg","0","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/comment.svg","1"

We are currently having a problem on all these systems with erasing sector zero with our custom MTD driver running on a PPC 440EP. All other sectors erase and program fine using that driver. Sector zero can be erased and programed under U-boot. If U-boot is used to boot the system, then our custom MTD driver can erase and program sector 0 correctly.","When it fails to erase, the flash reports a status of A2 after ~10us, which according to document #001-98285 Rev R means Erase failure because sector is locked. However, the sector is not locked. It can be programmed with U-boot and the MTD driver in the same way after a U-boot boot. Also, reading the lock state (both volatile or not) of that sector returns 1 (Unprotected). Trying to unprotect the sector has no effect. The memory map appears to be correct as I can read the sector correctly from the MTD driver and all commands issued to the flash at that base address work (except the erase of sector zero). The bus speed is the same under U-boot or the factory boot (125ns). Nothing in the documentation hints at sector zero being special. The code to erase is very simple; the Sector address = base address in this case.","","#define AMD_CMD_ERASE_START                                      0x0080","","Show Less","By","frgo_4197001","","","","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/calender.svg","2019/4/22","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/view.svg","2436","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/like.svg","0","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/comment.svg","12"

Both flash devices are tested with a script running on Linux (version 2.6.29) which continuously erases/writes and verifies the write with read actions. On the S29GL01GP we have seen no issues with the script running for multiple hours (on -40 to +85 degrees Celsius). The S29GL01GT flash device works fine on +25 degrees and +85 degrees Celsius, we experience problems with the ready/busy status readout during the erase command on lower temperatures (-40 degrees Celsius). The ready/busy seems to indicate ""ready"" but the erase command is not completed. On the hardware we have two S29GL01GT NOR flash devices connected to a local bus which both show the issue.","","The Linux driver initiate a sector erase command and waits until the erase is finished by reading the toggle bit status. The Linux driver implementation is according to the data polling sequence illustrated in Figure 7 (S29GL01GT datasheet). When two consecutive reads have the same value the erase status is considered ""ready"". As a last check the driver reads the first word of the sector (driver used in word mode). When this is not 0xFFFF the last byte is not erased and the driver reports an error (MTD Erase failure: Input/output error). We have tried relaxing the read and write timing settings by adding more delay between read/write cycles, but unfortunately with no success.","","","Show Less","By","niluc_3872736","","","","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/calender.svg","2019/1/28","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/view.svg","1729","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/like.svg","0","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/comment.svg","10"

The system worked great when we were using Micron 2Gb flash devices, cfi command set 1, but those are end of life so we switched to the S70GL02GS, cfi commands set 2. It seems that the S70GL02 reports the whole device size instead of each die size. U-Boot would come up with ""ERROR: too many flash sectors"". After working though the code I added a fix to the end of the flash_fixup_amd function, qry->dev_size -= 1;. This fixed the U-Boot problem.

The system keeps randomly encountering a bug where the below message gets thrown and wlan0 is unresponsive until the system is rebooted (as outlined in the github thread found ). The firmware version the system currently reports is:","","","To summarize, I got the 4.14.79 kernel source, set variables, and compiled the kernel image just fine. When trying to build the backports package for the modules, I run into issues. The first time I tried building the kernel image, I simply put the variables in the console (did not add them explicitly to .config) and ran into a problem with 'regdb_has_valid_signature' and ""implicit declaration of function 'verify_pkcs7_signature'"". The second time around I explicitly added the variables to .config and everything went smooth. However, when trying to insert the compat.ko module, I get a message about ""Unknown symbol in module"" and dmesg says ""Unknown symbol hash_algo_name (err 0)"". Now, as far as I can tell that module does not exist on my system (cat /proc/kallsyms | grep hash_algo_name and hash_info both return nothing) and I don't know how to get around it.","Ultimately, I am trying to update the Wi-Fi driver and firmware to fix the bug at the top of the post and nothing more. I want to keep the modifications to this old system to a minimum. If that means using an older driver source that doesn't need the ""hash_algo_name"" symbol or hash_info module, then that is fine by me. If there is a way to compile the latest driver so that it doesn't have any need for the hash_info module, that is also fine by me. Whatever it takes to get a newer driver on the system that doesn't have the issue I keep running into randomly.","Show Less","By","mrfrizzy","https://community.infineon.com/html/@DB310C00FCF7164DF57F5E9E38A34695/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BB7CBF68EA79EE2CE80785E7E8F100B7/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@4F31C10E63A8DEAD5447F4ACE23F9B35/badge_icons/Login_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/calender.svg","2024/4/18","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/view.svg","202","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/like.svg","0","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/comment.svg","3"

Expected would be that the USB PD negotiation fails and therefore the SAFE_PWR_EN should control the 5V out and connect the VBUS (which I measured also in this scenario at 5V) to the 5V output. But instead the SAFE_PWR_EN pin is high and therefore there is no 5V out.This is not acceptable from a usability perspective. So what is a possible fix for this? Would it maybe work to add 5.1K resistors to the CC1 and CC2 lines? Or would this interfere with the USB-PD IC? Or should I connect the D+ and D- lines of the USB-PD IC with the USB-C port?

I need to store when a switch is activated, and I am using the circuit shown above. The switches are connected to the input ports. the SR FF (flip flop) will store the value until the reset pin is activated according to what I've read. Then I can read the value from the register. My question is; how do I clear (reset) the FF? Can I tie the ""R"" input of the FF to a digital output port, and will that work?

The loads are driven through mosfets with the TLE8242-2. Power supply is also connected to BAT pin and when it is cutted off (switch open in the image below) from the load and it's still present on the BAT pin, the wrong read occurs.  The problem is:","I noticed that when I disconnect the load supply and at least one of the eight channels is controlled with a current > 0mA it's all fine because the read is 0 for all the ch ( GOOD because the power is disconnected in parallel for all the 8 ch) instead when current set point is 0 for all the 8 ch the response to Message #13  Average Current Read over dither period is wrong (is >0 when it should be 0).","The schematics is similar to the datasheet application diagram but Rsense = 0.1 Ohm Vbat = 12V, Rpos=Rneg=100 Ohm resistors added. Pushbutton cut off power going to load so it acts like an open cirtcuit beetwen the node above the BAT pin and the node above the diode (see image).","The problem is that my application set the channel current to 0 mA (mosfet OFF) when a short to ground is detected, when it happens the Drain voltage rise to 1.2V - 1.5V and a current of approximately 630 mA is read from TLE8242-2 when the load current measured is 0 mA because power is disconnected.","Show Less","By","MPmerlo","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BB7CBF68EA79EE2CE80785E7E8F100B7/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@4F31C10E63A8DEAD5447F4ACE23F9B35/badge_icons/Login_1.svg","","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/calender.svg","2024/5/3","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/view.svg","138","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/like.svg","0","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/comment.svg","1"

We have seen this behavior on two of our designs and on the TC2X9 Triboard. In debug mode the Receive Watchdog Timeout bit causes an interrupt and data corruption is seen when reviewing the Rx buffers. This eventually leads to the receiver halting, no longer receiving any messages and the missed FIFO counter being filled with the missed messages. We are trying to determine the root cause of the data corruption and the halting of the receiver. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.","Note, with our current test configuration we have also seen that disabling the ""Automatic Pad or CRC Stripping"" and ""CRC Stripping of Type FRAMES"" in the MAC configuration prevents the receiver from halting, but we would like to know the root cause of this issue.","","","","Show Less","By","TR932_XT","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BB7CBF68EA79EE2CE80785E7E8F100B7/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@DB310C00FCF7164DF57F5E9E38A34695/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@4F31C10E63A8DEAD5447F4ACE23F9B35/badge_icons/Login_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/calender.svg","2024/4/23","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/view.svg","67","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/like.svg","0","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/comment.svg","1"

PSoC and W5500 communicate using the SPI protocol. As mentioned in the W5500 datasheet, I have written a function. To read or write from the W5500, there are two functions: byte read or write, and SPI bus read or write.","For reading a byte, you need to send 3 bytes of data (address) and the last byte as a dummy byte for the response, totaling four bytes. According to the SPI protocol, there is a version register to read (0x39), and the expected response is 0x04. The data sent from PSoC to W5500 is (0x00, 0x39, 0x00, 0xFF), and the response is (0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04). However, when I print the version register, it shows the response as 0x03.

My output shall be 28V. The 1st supply should deliver 200W and the 2nd supply should deliver 400W. I was first considering the LLC topology with ICE2HS01G-DS but after going into some reference material, found that EMI will be a problem later on due to the varying frequency of the converter. I therefore am considering a forward converter topology with an active clamp. I want to use the same topology for both designs in order to re-use circuitry and minimize risk. I came across the XDPP1100 digital power controller but what I would like to verify is whether the choice of topology and controller is in fact the optimum choice. I am not space constraint but my operating temperature will be at a maximum of 65 deg C, so efficiency is critical. I do not have forced air to cool down my design so I will have to rely on conduction cooling.

Is this the value of the external gate resistance applied to the MOSFET? or else?","(2) When trying to simulate via LT spice the switching loss, I used the circuit below, which I adapted from the diagram in the 2006 Infineon app note. (In LTSpice, the MOSFET was already present in the library after I installed it). In the circuit, I guessed the values of turn on gate resistance, and turn off gate resistance, but I am not sure these are ok. Should I just use one resistance in the gate with a value of RG = 1.6 Ohm? I am asking because the switching loss loss that I measure on LTspice on Mosfet M1 results about twice as big compared to the switching loss on M1 I calculated using the method described in the 2006 Infineon application note I stated above.

It seems like there are two different settings affecting the field weakening controller.","1. In Solution designer setting-> motor control configuration>Control Regulators, there exists field weakening current limit as well as modulation threshold at which field weakening should get activated.","How do these two settings work together? In other words, if I disable field weakening in 1 above (by setting current limit to 0%), while disabling over modulation in setting 2, will field weakening controller be activated? If yes, at what modulation will it get activated (linear modulation range is until 86.6% motor voltage)","My observation during testing when I set a field weakening current limit of 10% (I also had SVPWM over modulation disabled) was that when I increased speed of the motor, the 10% limit was not respected.  It is very strange that there is no documentation on the field weakening behaviour of the IMC in the reference or the software manual. Hence, I am forced to ask here.","Show Less","By","rahulpillai","https://community.infineon.com/html/@9FC46A0208CA612D6CB0C9007C71D09A/badge_icons/Login_10.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@DB310C00FCF7164DF57F5E9E38A34695/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BBEC66922B1C4B9B7C6B587E96E232D8/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_5.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/calender.svg","2024/4/19","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/view.svg","136","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/like.svg","0","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/comment.svg","4"

I had bought a J-LINK Mini but found out that the 3.3V is not compatible with the BLDC Shield's 5V. In the Shield documentation, a J-Link Lite device is used, but I can't find where to buy this anywhere. So my questions are, is the Segger product line, the only one which can be used? What programmer models can be used? Are there other J-TAG devices I can use (like Keil ULINK2). I'd rather not have to spend $500 for a programmer, when my sole purpose is to be able to adjust the setparameter() for the particular motors I am using. Or do I need to buy a TLE9879 Eval board with the built in Segger in order to program the BLDC Shield... which at least a cheaper option than Segger directly.","Thanks","","","","Show Less","By","Smitty99","https://community.infineon.com/html/@8D0CEDDB2B2BA0125F60F1F756154B75/badge_icons/Likes%20given_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@5314BCBE1A8075802F557371685FC5CB/badge_icons/Login_5.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@DB310C00FCF7164DF57F5E9E38A34695/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/calender.svg","2024/4/26","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/view.svg","79","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/like.svg","0","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/comment.svg","2"

IM73D122 fits my requirement and I am trying to design a circuit to test things. I have 3 questions :1. Is there any recommendation for codec or ADC if I wish to capture data from 2 microphones ? The datasheet shows connected data and clock line for both of them, is that correct? 2. I have previous experience of working with I2S protocol for ESP32 and I wish to use that to acquire my data in the end. Do I need a separate converter?3. I notice that the f_pdm can be set and a decimation factor can be set too. How would I go along to set these properties in the software side? Are there registers I need to update? I could not find suggestions on this. Appreciate your help.

Also, any tips and tricks to help me get started with reprogramming the CY22393 device would be greatly appreciated. i couldn't only find posts about this product and my specific issue unless they were from 2008-2009. so i wasnt sure how valid those post still were.Thanks for the help.","","","","","Show Less","By","msn47","https://community.infineon.com/html/@4845BE2359674DBCE16B5A976BD412C8/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_5.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@5314BCBE1A8075802F557371685FC5CB/badge_icons/Login_5.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@DB310C00FCF7164DF57F5E9E38A34695/badge_icons/Reply%20to%20questions_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/calender.svg","2022/8/16","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/view.svg","1123","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/like.svg","0","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/comment.svg","6"

As the boards are not yet ready, I am simulating the setup using two ports on a Relax 4500 board. The code is adapted from a DAVE example with standard settings and configured to use interrupts on both master and slave. The main file is given below and the others are completely standard DAVE generated MASTER and SLAVE apps. The code copies a set of values to the slaveData buffer which is then sent by the slave to the master where it is placed in the masterData buffer. The slave catches the falling edge of the SPI CSEL signal and starts listening for data. Once the trigger byte has been received the slave uses the SlaveRxCompleteCB() callback to setup the data to be transmitted to the master and calls SPI_SLAVE_Transmit() to perform this act.","My problems are:","1.

I thought that as the ADC's in-built reference voltage is 3.3V, the output of the ADC would be 1023 based on the ADC's general conversion formula.                 However, the ADC is printing arbitrary values on the display. Rather than printing 1023, it is printing values such as 328, 320, 240, 230, 1045 etc. Can anyone please help resolve this issue. I am attaching the ADC code that I have written for my application. I am using Dave 3.0 software.","","","","","Show Less","By","Tarun_M","https://community.infineon.com/html/@5314BCBE1A8075802F557371685FC5CB/badge_icons/Login_5.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@8D0CEDDB2B2BA0125F60F1F756154B75/badge_icons/Likes%20given_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/@BB7CBF68EA79EE2CE80785E7E8F100B7/badge_icons/Questions%20asked_1.svg","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/calender.svg","2024/4/24","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/view.svg","45","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/like.svg","0","https://community.infineon.com/html/assets/comment.svg","1"

Is it illegal to generate a PWM within a Timer interrupt?
